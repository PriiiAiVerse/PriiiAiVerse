## 🧩 About Me

I'm on a continuous journey of learning and building in the world of **Artificial Intelligence**, **Machine Learning**, **NLP**, and **Intelligent Systems**.  
Starting with Python in 2023, I progressed from ML models to deploying deep learning solutions, and now exploring **LLMs**, **Agents**, and **AI-powered applications**.

Along the way, I’ve explored data analysis, web apps, recommendation engines, automation bots, and more — all while focusing on understanding the **why**, not just the how.

## 🚀 What I'm Up To

- 📌 Actively uploading projects — not all at once to keep things clean.
- 🛠️ The major, time-intensive projects from each domain will be up in 2 weeks .
- 🔄 Gradually pushing smaller, practical projects from each topic I’ve explored.

### 🧠 My Journey So Far

- **2023** — Started with Python, building small projects to understand programming fundamentals.
- **Early 2024** — Entered the world of ML with datasets, classification , regression models and hands-on data exploration through Power BI dashboards.
- **Mid-Late 2024** — Neural Network Unexpectedly immersed me in deep learning ! Explored CNNs and worked with **VGG16**, **ResNet**, **InceptionV3**, **UNet**, and **MobileNet**.
- **Early 2025** — Even had a chance to write  research paper  on Autism Spectrum Disorder using InceptionV3.
- **2025** — Inspired by OpenAI and DeepSeek, I entered **NLP & LLMs**, exploring **transformers**, **LLMs**, and now building **AI agents** using tools like LangChain and LangGraph.

I love blending science with storytelling — and I'm always ready to turn models into magic.
